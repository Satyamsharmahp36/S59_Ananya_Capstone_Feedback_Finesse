# Feedback Finesse - Hostel Complaint Registration Portal

As a part of my capstone project, I have decided to make a complaint portal where college students living in hostels can submit their grievances. Being a hosteller myself, I often face problems while contacting the concerned authorities regarding certain issues that I might be facing. We are usually supposed to write complaints in a physical register. However, these complaints are sometimes left unseen and I felt like the need of centralising this entire process.

My aim with this project is to simplify the procedure of filing complaints for hostellers. They will get options to add reviews for hostel food, choose their respective hostels and register a complaint, etc. I will allow myself to further scale on this idea if time permits. My initial focus would stay on the complaint registering process only.

## Objective

The project aims to develop a centralized online platform for college hostel students to submit grievances and complaints. This platform will streamline the complaint filing process, enhance communication with authorities, and improve the overall hostel experience.

## Features

- Options to select the type of complaint (e.g., maintenance, facilities, noise disturbance).
- Allow students to write detailed descriptions and upload supporting documents (optional).

### Hostel Reviews

- Enable students to leave reviews and feedback on hostel facilities and services.
- Categories for reviews such as food quality, cleanliness, staff behavior, etc.
- Aggregate reviews to provide an overall rating for each hostel.
- Help prospective students make informed decisions about hostel preferences.

### Registration/Login Page

- Students must register and log in using their email and password.
- Authentication process to ensure authorized access to complaint submission and review features.

### Backend Development
